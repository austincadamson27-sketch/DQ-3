  <h1>My Meaningful Image</h1>

  <img 
    src="IMG_2462.jpg" 
    alt="My dog Charlie lying on a blanket looking at the camera"
    style="width:300px; height:350px;"
  >

  <p>
    I chose this image because it is a picture of my dog Charlie, who is really important to me. She reminds me of
    home and brings me comfort, especially when I am stressed or busy with school.
