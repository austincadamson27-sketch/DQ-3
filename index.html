<<h1>My Meaningful Image</h1>

<img src="IMG_2462.jpg" alt="My dog lying on a blanket looking at the camera">

<p>
I chose this image because it is a picture of my dog Charlie, who is really important to me. She reminds me of
home and brings me comfort, especially when I am stressed or busy with school.
