  <h1>My Personal Portfolio</h1>

  <img
    src="IMG_2462.jpg"
    alt="My dog Charlie lying on a blanket looking at the camera"
    class="profile-img"
  >

  <p>
    I chose this image because it is a picture of my dog Charlie, who is really important to me. She reminds me of
    home and brings me comfort, especially when I am stressed or busy with school.

  <p>
    My name is Austin, and I’m a student at Mount Saint Joseph University. I’m studying Financial Economics and Social Computing,
    and I’m interested in learning more about data analytics and technology in business.

    Outside of school, I like working on projects that help me build useful skills for my future career. I also enjoy spending
    time with family and anything that helps me reset when life gets busy.
  </p>

  <p class="style-reason">
    I chose these styles because the clean layout, centered content, and simple colors make the page easy to read and look more professional.
